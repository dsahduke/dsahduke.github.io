Take some time to familiarize yourself with how slack works if you have not used it before. so we can avoid any further confusion down the line. In general, messages in default channels will be visible to everyone in the course. If you have a general question (for example about homework/due dates/lecture), please post your questions in the designated channel. Do not ask questions about your specific implementation. Please direct message one of the instructors in this case.


## MIMIC-III and Physionet

Because this course deals with health record data, you will need to go through the process of obtaining access to the MIMIC-III database. Instructions on how to do this are located below. This will be your first assignment for the course.
